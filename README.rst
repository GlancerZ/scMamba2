# SC-MAMBA2: Leveraging State-Space Models for Efficient Single-Cell Ultra-Long Transcriptome Modeling

This repository contains the code for the `SC-MAMBA2` package for modoling single-cell transcriptome data.
In In [our study](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-021-01336-8), we applied the state-space model [MAMBA2] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21060) to single-cell transcriptomics, developing the SC-MAMBA2 model. SC-MAMBA2 leverages the efficiency and scalability of SSM, enabling it to handle ultra-long transcriptome sequences with lower computational cost. The model was trained on a dataset of 57 million cells, making it the most comprehensive solution to date for processing ultra-long sequences. Extensive benchmarking across various downstream tasks consistently demonstrated SC-MAMBA2's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, showcasing exceptional accuracy and computational efficiency.
